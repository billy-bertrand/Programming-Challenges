`Challenge Number`: #38

`Programming language used`: C++

`Prompt`:

Write a short program that implements 2 functions

1. Fizz Buzz - iterative solution

2. Fizz Buzz - recursive solution

The way `Fizz Buzz` works, is your function should take in a value `n`, then iterate through all numbers of `1 - n`and print out `Fizz` if the number is divisible by `3`, print `Buzz` if the number is divisible by `5`, and print `Fizz Buzz` if the number is divisible by both `3` and `5`. If the number is neither divisible by `3` or `5`, then just print the number. If `n = 5`, your output should look like this:

```
Fizz Buzz - Iterative
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Done!

Fizz Buzz - Recursive
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Done!
```
