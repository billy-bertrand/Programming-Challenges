`Challenge Number`: #26

`Programming language used`: C

`Prompt`: Create a `Vector` Object that holds an `x` & `y` `Float` value, Add functions to this object that add, subtract, and functions to multiply and divide vector objects by a scalar.

`Learned Objectives`:
- Just for fun ðŸ˜Ž.

`How should reviewers run the code`:

- Using `GCC`, compile the `main.c` and `vector2d.c` files

*Note: Be sure to add the `include` folder in GCC's include path. You can do that using the `-I` flag* ðŸ¤
