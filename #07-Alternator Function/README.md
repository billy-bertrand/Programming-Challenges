`Challenge Number`: #34

`Programming language used`: C

`Prompt`:

Write a function called `alternator` that returns `1` the first time it is called, `0` the 2nd time, `1` the 3rd time, and so forth...

`Learning Objective(s)`:

- Practice using `static` variable

`How did I solve the problem`:

I am aware that `static` variables remain in memory as long as a program runs, so:

1. I store the value to be returned in a `static` variable.

2. Either increment/decrement its value each time the function gets called, and return it.
