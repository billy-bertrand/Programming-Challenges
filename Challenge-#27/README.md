`Challenge Number`: #27
`Programming language used`: C
`Prompt`: Consider the following list of randomly generated integers:

`[25, 31, 60, 91, 14, 78, 28, 29, 0, 57, 72, 89, 79, 20, 27, 19, 100, 3, 51]`
Write a **recursive** function that takes the above list as parameter, and returns their sum.
`Learned Objectives`:
- Practice writing recursive functions.
