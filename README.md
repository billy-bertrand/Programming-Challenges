# Programming-Challenges
This repository hosts all programming challenges I worked on from its date of creation till today :)

# How is the repository organized?
This repo is organized into folders. Each folder represents a programming challenge, and is named following the this scheme: `Challenge-#n`.

Each folder contains:
- A `README.md` file, giving information about the challenge.
- An `include` folder, to store header files.
- A `src` folder, to store source files.

# Why Am I doing this?

1. For myself. I find this idea cool.
2. To practice using `Git` commands from my terminal.
3. To track programming challenges I work on in the [Coding Dojo](https://discord.gg/eHBzqbedXZ) Discord server. Feel free to join, and practice alonside us!
