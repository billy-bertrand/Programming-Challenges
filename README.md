# Programming-Dojo
This repository is my practice area. It hosts programming exercises I worked on to :)

# How is the repository organized?
This repo is organized into folders. Each folder represents a programming exercise, and is named following this scheme: `#n-challenge_name`.

Each folder contains:
- A `README.md` file, giving information about the challenge.

# Why Am I doing this?

1. For myself. I find this idea cool.
2. To practice using `Git` commands from my terminal.
